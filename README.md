<i> "Hello! that's the result of my initial studies about postgres <br>
and SQL language."</i> <br>

Hello, here you'll see some of the few results of my studies in the SQL language, using
DML and DDL resources to make this repository the most complex in this profile.
To create the databases, i'll be using VSCODE; to provide data, i'll use DW resources.
<br>At all, it's a amount of my initial studies in SQL, i hope you like it.
