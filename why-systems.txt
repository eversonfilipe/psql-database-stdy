"Why did you chose 'Space Systems' as examples?'"
---------------------------------------------------------------

Hello, i chose the "xxx Systems" example to rename the
.sql files in my repositor because of it's abstraction
while in a "miniworld", which can be easily used for
study's examples or self-improvement as well.

By the way, i made this databases using PostgreSQL, which
is free and open-source; these things helped me to
increase my job and resolution of problems, while in database.
